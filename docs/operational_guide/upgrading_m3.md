# Upgrading M3

## Overview

This guide explains how to upgrade M3 from one version to another (e.g. from 0.14.0 to 0.15.0).
This includes upgrading:

- m3dbnode
- m3coordinator
- m3query
- m3aggregator

## m3dbnode

### Graphs to monitor

While upgrading M3DB nodes, it's important to monitor the status of bootstrapping the individual nodes. This can be monitored using the [M3DB Node Details](https://github.com/m3db/m3/blob/master/integrations/grafana/m3db_dashboard.json) dashboard.
Typically, the `Bootstrapped` graph under `Background Tasks` and the graphs within the `CPU and Memory Utilization` give a good understanding of how well bootstrapping is going.

### Kubernetes

If running `M3DB` on Kubernetes, upgrade by completing the following steps. 

1. Identify the version of m3dbnode to upgrade to [on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/m3db/m3dbnode?tab=tags).

2. Replace the Docker image in the `StatefulSet` manifest (or `m3db-operator` manifest) to be the new version of m3dbnode.

```yaml
spec:
  image: quay.io/m3db/m3dbnode:$VERSION
```

3. Once updated, apply the updated manifest and a rolling restart will be performed. You must wait until the `StatefulSet` is entirely upgraded and bootstrapped (as per the M3DB Node Details dashboard) before proceeding to the next `StatefulSet` otherwise multiple replicas will be unavailable at once.

```bash
kubectl apply -f <m3dbnode_manifest>
```

### Downgrading

The `upgrading` steps above can also be used to downgrade M3DB. However, it is important to refer to the release notes to make sure that versions are
backwards compatible.

## m3coordinator

`m3coordinator` can be upgraded using similar steps as `m3dbnode`, however, the images can be [found here](https://quay.io/repository/m3db/m3coordinator) instead.

## m3query

`m3query` can be upgraded using similar steps as `m3dbnode`, however, the images can be [found here](https://quay.io/repository/m3db/m3query) instead.

## m3aggregator

`m3aggregator` can be upgraded using similar steps as `m3dbnode`, however, the images can be [found here](https://quay.io/repository/m3db/m3aggregator) instead.

### Non-Kubernetes

It is very important that for each replica set, only one node gets upgraded at a time. However, multiple nodes can be upgraded across replica sets. 

1) Download new binary (linux example below).

```bash
wget "https://github.com/m3db/m3/releases/download/v$VERSION/m3_$VERSION_linux_amd64.tar.gz" && tar xvzf m3_$VERSION_linux_amd64.tar.gz && rm m3_$VERSION_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

2) Stop and upgrade one M3DB node at a time per replica set using the [systemd unit](https://github.com/m3db/m3/blob/master/integrations/systemd/m3dbnode.service).

```bash
# stop m3dbnode
sudo systemctl stop m3dbnode

# start m3dbnode with the new binary (which should be placed in the path specified in the systemd unit)
sudo systemctl start m3dbnode
```

*Note:* If unable to stop `m3dbnode` using `systemctl`, use `pkill` instead.

```bash
# stop m3dbnode
pkill m3dbnode

# start m3dbnode with new binary
./m3_$VERSION_linux_amd64/m3dbnode -f <config-name.yml>
```

3) Confirm m3dbnode has finished bootstrapping.

```

4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes have been upgraded.
