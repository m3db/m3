# DocTest

`doctest` is a utility to test and generate our documentation. The script is built into our CI and does two main things:

1. Strips out all of the scripts and commands (along with the appropriate validation commands) that are embedded in our documentation and generates a bash file that can be run in our CI.
2. Creates a markdown file which is stored in our public repo.

# Usage

It's important to note that `doctest` reads from our `.md.source` files so users should only update those. The true `.md` files are generated by the script.

To run the script, you can use `go run` and pass in a file to the `--file` flag. In the below example, the bash script and markdown file will be named `single_node.sh` and `single_node.md` respectively.

```
go run doctest.go --file=$GOPATH/src/github.com/m3db/m3/docs/how_to/resources/single_node.md.source
```
