package transformation

import "time"

// transformReset returns the provided datapoint and a zero datapoint one second later.
//
// This transform is useful for force resetting a counter value in Prometheus. When running the M3Aggregator in HA, both
// the follower and leader are computing aggregate counters, but they started counting at different times. If these
// counters are emitted as monotonic cumulative counters, during failover the counter decreases if the new leader
// started counting later. Prometheus assumes any decrease in a counter is due a counter reset, which leads to strange
// display results since the counter did not actually reset.
//
// This transform gets around this issue by explicitly not accumulating results, like Add, and force resets the counter
// with a zero value so PromQL properly graphs the delta as the rate value.
//
// This does have the downside of an extra 0 datapoint per resolution period. The storage cost is more than just the
// extra 0 value since the value is stored 1 second after the actual datapoint. This degrades the timestamp encoding
// since the timestamps are no longer at a fixed interval. In practice we see a 3x increase in storage for these
// aggregated counters.
//
// Currently only a single extra datapoint per aggregation is supported. If multiple transforms in an aggregation emit
// an additional datapoint, only the last one is used.
