m3em
====

`m3em` (pronounced `meme`) is an acronym for M3DB Environment Manager. Think (CCM)[https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm] for M3DB, without the restriction of operating solely on the localhost.

The goal of `m3em` is to make it easy to create, manage and destroy small M3DB clusters across hosts. It is meant for testing a M3DB cluster.
