# M3Ctl UI

Note: Work in progress.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Running the Application

First, install yarn for faster npm install
```
brew install yarn
```

We need atleast Node v6, to switch use nvm:
```
nvm install 6
nvm use 6
```

Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

Run the UI in dev mode. The API is expected to be available at: http://localhost:9000/r2/v1/

```
npm start
```
