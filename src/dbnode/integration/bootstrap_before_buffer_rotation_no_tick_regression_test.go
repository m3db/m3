// TestBootstrapBeforeBufferRotationNoTick was added as a regression test after we identified
// an issue where blocks that were bootstrapped would sometimes be placed into series
// buffers that would not be drained before the next flush. Since the flush does not check
// for data in the buffer, if the buffers aren't drained then the bootstrapped data will
// be lose.
// A concrete example of this would be that a node with 2 hour block-size and 10 minute
// bufferPast goes down at 2:11PM. It turns back on and starts bootstrapping. There is
// an allocated series buffer bucket for the 12PM->2PM block, but it never gets drained
// because it doesn't have any data in it. While bootstrap is going on, a background tick
// is also occurring. The tick is 95% complete, and then the bootstrap completes and the
// blocks are all loaded into the series buffer. A small minority of series buffer buckets
// which hadn't already been ticked get drained, but the vast majority remain undrained.
// Once the tick finishes, the node begins flushing the 12PM->2PM block because the main
// requirements for performing a flush are as follows:
// 		1) currentTime > blockStart.Add(blockSize).Add(bufferPast)
// 		2) node is not bootstrapping (technically shard is not bootstrapping)
// 		3) at least one complete tick has occurred since blockStart.Add(blockSize).Add(bufferPast)
// This flush will lose a large portion of the bootstrapped data because its still stuck in
// the undrained series buffer 12PM->12PM bucket. As a result, it became clear that a four invariant
// needed to be maintained:
//		4) at least one complete tick has occurred since bootstrap completed (can be the same tick
// 		   that satisfies condition #3)
// This integration test ensures that we handle that situation properly by writing out
// a commitlog file that has a single write in the active block, then it starts the node
// and ensures that a tick starts before bootstrap begins and ends after bootstrap ends.
// We accomplish this by modifying the minimumTickFlushInterval runtime option.
// Finally, it verifies that the data from the commitlog is persisted and not lost.
