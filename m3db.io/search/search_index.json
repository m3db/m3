Please note that this is alpha software , and as such its APIs and behavior are subject to breaking changes. While we aim to produce thoroughly tested reliable software there may be undiscovered bugs. For more background on the M3DB operator, see our KubeCon keynote on its origins and usage at Uber. Philosophy The M3DB operator aims to automate everyday tasks around managing M3DB. Specifically, it aims to automate: Creating M3DB clusters Destroying M3DB clusters Expanding clusters (adding instances) Shrinking clusters (removing instances) Replacing failed instances It explicitly does not try to automate every single edge case a user may ever run into. For example, it does not aim to automate disaster recovery if an entire cluster is taken down. Such use cases may still require human intervention, but the operator will aim to not conflict with such operations a human may have to take on a cluster. Generally speaking, the operator's philosophy is if it would be unclear to a human what action to take, we will not try to guess.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#m3db-operator","text":"","title":"M3DB Operator"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Welcome to the documentation for the M3DB operator, a Kubernetes operator for running the open-source timeseries database M3DB on Kubernetes.

M3DB was built with failure tolerance as a core feature. M3DB's isolation groups allow shards to be placed across failure domains such that the loss of no single domain can cause the cluster to lose quorum. More details on M3DB's resiliency can be found in the deployment docs . By leveraging Kubernetes' node affinity and M3DB's isolation groups, the operator can guarantee that M3DB pods are distributed across failure domains. For example, in a Kubernetes cluster spread across 3 zones in a cloud region, the isolationGroups configuration below would guarantee that no single zone failure could degrade the M3DB cluster. M3DB is unaware of the underlying zone topology: it just views the isolation groups as group1 , group2 , group3 in its placement . Thanks to the Kubernetes scheduler, however, these groups are actually scheduled across separate failure domains. apiVersion : operator.m3db.io/v1alpha1 kind : M3DBCluster ... spec : replicationFactor : 3 isolationGroups : - name : group1 numInstances : 3 nodeAffinityTerms : - key : failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values : - us-east1-b - name : group2 numInstances : 3 nodeAffinityTerms : - key : failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values : - us-east1-c - name : group3 numInstances : 3 nodeAffinityTerms : - key : failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values : - us-east1-d Tolerations In addition to allowing pods to be assigned to certain nodes via node affinity, Kubernetes allows pods to be repelled from nodes through taints if they don't tolerate the taint. For example, the following config would ensure: Pods are spread across zones. Pods are only assigned to nodes in the m3db-dedicated-pool pool. No other pods could be assigned to those nodes (assuming they were tainted with the taint m3db-dedicated-taint ). apiVersion : operator.m3db.io/v1alpha1 kind : M3DBCluster ... spec : replicationFactor : 3 isolationGroups : - name : group1 numInstances : 3 nodeAffinityTerms : - key : failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values : - us-east1-b - key : nodepool values : - m3db-dedicated-pool - name : group2 numInstances : 3 nodeAffinityTerms : - key : failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values : - us-east1-c - key : nodepool values : - m3db-dedicated-pool - name : group3 numInstances : 3 nodeAffinityTerms : - key : failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values : - us-east1-d - key : nodepool values : - m3db-dedicated-pool tolerations : - key : m3db-dedicated effect : NoSchedule operator : Exists Example Affinity Configurations Zonal Cluster The examples so far have focused on multi-zone Kubernetes clusters. Some users may only have a cluster in a single zone and accept the reduced fault tolerance. The following configuration shows how to configure the operator in a zonal cluster. apiVersion : operator.m3db.io/v1alpha1 kind : M3DBCluster ... spec : replicationFactor : 3 isolationGroups : - name : group1 numInstances : 3 nodeAffinityTerms : - key : failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values : - us-east1-b - name : group2 numInstances : 3 nodeAffinityTerms : - key : failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values : - us-east1-b - name : group3 numInstances : 3 nodeAffinityTerms : - key : failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values : - us-east1-b 6 Zone Cluster In the above examples we created clusters with 1 isolation group in each of 3 zones. Because values within a single NodeAffinityTerm are OR'd, we can also spread an isolationgroup across multiple zones. For example, if we had 6 zones available to us: apiVersion : operator.m3db.io/v1alpha1 kind : M3DBCluster ... spec : replicationFactor : 3 isolationGroups : - name : group1 numInstances : 3 nodeAffinityTerms : - key : failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values : - us-east1-a - us-east1-b - name : group2 numInstances : 3 nodeAffinityTerms : - key : failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values : - us-east1-c - us-east1-d - name : group3 numInstances : 3 nodeAffinityTerms : - key : failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values : - us-east1-e - us-east1-f No Affinity If there are no failure domains available, one can have a cluster with no affinity where the pods will be scheduled however Kubernetes would place them by default: apiVersion : operator.m3db.io/v1alpha1 kind : M3DBCluster ... spec : replicationFactor : 3 isolationGroups : - name : group1 numInstances : 3 - name : group2 numInstances : 3 - name : group3 numInstances : 3","title":"Node Affinity & Cluster Topology"},{"location":"configuration/node_affinity/#node-affinity-cluster-topology","text":"","title":"Node Affinity &amp; Cluster Topology"},{"location":"configuration/node_affinity/#node-affinity","text":"Kubernetes allows pods to be assigned to nodes based on various critera through node affinity .

Consequentially this means it will begin serving reads for that data. For more background on M3DB topology, see the M3DB topology docs . In most environments in which M3DB has been deployed in production, it has been on a set of hosts predetermined by whomever is managing the cluster. This means that an M3DB instance is identified in a toplogy by its hostname, and that when an M3DB process comes up and finds its hostname in the cluster with Available shards that it can serve reads for those shards. This does not work on Kubernetes, particularly when working with StatefulSets, as a pod may be rescheduled on a new node or with new storage attached but its name may stay the same. If we were to naively use an instance's hostname (pod name), and it were to get rescheduled on a new node with no data, it could assume that absence of data is valid and begin returning empty results for read requests. To account for this, the M3DB Operator determines an M3DB instance's identity in the topology based on a configurable set of metadata about the pod. Configuration The M3DB operator uses a configurable set of metadata about a pod to determine its identity in the M3DB placement. This is encapsulated in the PodIdentityConfig field of a cluster's spec. In addition to the configures sources, a pod's name will always be included.
