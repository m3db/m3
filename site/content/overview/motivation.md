We decided to open source the M3 platform as a scalable remote storage backend for Prometheus and Graphite so that others may attempt to reuse our work and avoid building yet another scalable metrics platform. As documentation for Prometheus states, it is limited by single nodes in its scalability and durability. The M3 platform aims to provide a turnkey, scalable, and configurable multi-tenant store for Prometheus, Graphite and other standard metrics schemas.
