# This manifest provides a daemonset that will ensure the host's sysctls are set
# to M3DB's recommended values.
#
# WARNING: This will run a PRIVILEGED ROOT container on your HOST that will
# modify host sysctl values. This is designed for managed Kubernetes platforms
# that may have restrictions like read-only root FS, inability to set startup
# scripts, etc. In very rare circumstances should you use this, and should
# intead opt to use your usual host provisioning tooling to set these values.
#
# This daemonset pins to a specific SHA digest in the event that the M3DB Quay
# repo is ever compromised. The manifest of this image can be verified here:
