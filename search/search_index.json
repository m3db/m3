This high compression ratio is implemented via the M3TSZ algorithm, a variant of the streaming time series compression algorithm described in \nFacebook's Gorilla paper\n with a few small differences.\n\n\nThe compression ratio will vary depending on the workload and configuration, but we found that with M3TSZ we were able to achieve a compression ratio of 1.45 bytes/datapoint with Uber's production workloads.

A \nseries\n is generally what comes to mind when you think of \"time series\" data. Ex. The CPU level for a single host in a datacenter over a period of time could be represented as a series with id \"\n.system.cpu.utilization\" and a vector of tuples in the form of (TIMESTAMP, CPU_LEVEL). In other words, if you were rendering a graph a series would represent a single line on that graph. Note that the previous example is only a logical illustration and does not represent the way that M3DB actually stores data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlocks\n belong to a series and are central to M3DB's design. A \nblock\n is simply a smaller wrapper object around a sealed (no longer writable) stream of compressed time series data. The compression comes with a few caveats though, namely that you cannot read individual datapoints in a compressed block. In other words, in order to read a single datapoint you must decompress the entire block up to the datapoint that you're trying to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf M3DB kept everything in memory (and in fact, early versions of it did), than you could conceptually think of it as being a composed from a hierarchy of maps:\n\n\ndatabase_obect      =\n map\n\nnamespace_object    =\n map\n\nshard_object        =\n map\n\nseries_object       =\n map\n\nseries_object       =\n map\n (This map should only have one or two entries)\n\n\nPersistent storage\n\n\nWhile in-memory databases can be useful (and M3DB supports operating in a memory-only mode), some form of persistence is required for durability. In other words, without a persistence strategy then it would be impossible for M3DB to restart (or recover from a crash) without losing all of its data.\n\n\nIn addition, with large volumes of data it becomes prohibitively expensive to keep all of the data in memory. This is especially true for monitoring workloads which often follow a \"write-once, read-never\" pattern where less than a few percent of all the data that's stored is ever read. With that type of workload, its wasteful to keep all of that data in memory when it could be persisted on disk and retrieved when required.\n\n\nLike most other databases, M3DB takes a two-pronged approach to persistant storage that involves combining a commitlog (for disaster recovery) with periodic snapshotting (for efficient retrieval):\n\n\n\n\nAll writes are persisted to a \ncommitlog\n (the commitlog can be configured to fsync every write, or optionally batch writes together which is much faster but leaves open the possibility of small amounts of data loss in the case of a catastrophic failure). The commitlog is completely uncompressed and exists only to recover \"unflushed\" data in the case of a database shutdown (intentional or not) and is never used to satisfy a read request.\n\n\nPeriodically (based on the configured blocksize) all \"active\" blocks are \"sealed\" (marked as immutable) and flushed to disk as \n\"fileset\" files\n. These files are highly compressed and can be indexed into via their complementary index files. Check out the \nflushing section\n to learn more about the background flushing process.\n\n\n\n\nThe blocksize parameter is the most important variable that needs to be tuned for your particular workload. A small blocksize will mean more frequent flushing and a smaller memory footprint for the data that is being actively compressed, but it will also reduce the compression ratio and your data will take up more space on disk.\n\n\nIf the database is stopped for any reason in-between \"flushes\" (writing fileset files out to disk), then when the node is started back up those writes will need to be recovered by reading the commitlog or streaming in the data from a peer responsible for the same shard (if the replication factor is larger than 1).\n\n\nWhile the \nfileset files\n are designed to support efficient data retrieval via the series primary key (the ID), there is still a heavy cost associated with any query that has to retrieve data from disk because going to disk is always much slower than accessing main memory. To compensate for that, M3DB support various \ncaching policies\n which can significantly improve the performance of reads by caching data in memory.\n\n\nWrite Path\n\n\nWe now have enough context of M3DB's architecture to discuss the lifecycle of a write. A write begins when an M3DB client calls the \nwriteBatchRaw\n endpoint on M3DB's embedded thrift server. The write itself will contain the following information:\n\n\n\n\nThe namespace\n\n\nThe series ID (byte blob)\n\n\nThe timestamp\n\n\nThe value itself\n\n\n\n\nM3DB will consult the database object to check if the namespace exists, and if it does,then it will hash the series ID to determine which shard it belongs to. If the node receiving the write owns that shard, then it will lookup the series in the shard object. If the series exists, then it will lookup the series' corresponding encoder and encode the datapoint into the compressed stream. If the encoder doesn't exist (no writes for this series have occurred yet as part of this block) then a new encoder will be allocated and it will begin a compressed M3TSZ stream with that datapoint. There is also some special logic for handling out-of-order writes which is discussed in the \nmerging all encoders section\n.\n\n\nAt the same time, the write will be appended to the commitlog queue (and depending on the commitlog configuration immediately fsync'd to disk or batched together with other writes and flushed out all at once).\n\n\nThe write will exist only in this \"active buffer\" and the commitlog until the block ends and is flushed to disk, at which point the write will exist in a fileset file for efficient storage and retrieval later and the commitlog entry can be garbage collected.\n\n\nNote:\n Regardless of the success or failure of the write in a single node, the client will return a success or failure to the caller for the write based on the configured \nconsistency level\n.\n\n\nRead Path\n\n\nA read begins when an M3DB client calls the \nFetchBatchResult\n or \nFetchBlocksRawResult\n endpoint on M3DB's embedded thrift server. The read request will contain the following information:\n\n\n\n\nThe namespace\n\n\nThe series ID (byte blob)\n\n\nThe period of time being requested (start and end)\n\n\n\n\nM3DB will consult the database object to check if the namespace exists, and if it does, then it will hash the series ID to determine which shard it belongs to. If the node receiving the read owns that shard, then M3DB needs to determine two things:\n\n\n\n\nDoes the series exist? and if it does\n\n\nDoes the data exist in an \"active buffer\" (actively being compressed by an encoder), cached in-memory, on disk, or some combination of all three?\n\n\n\n\nDetermining whether the series exists is simple. M3DB looks up the series in the shard object. If it exists, then the series exists. If it doesn't, then M3DB consults an in-memory bloom filter(s) for that shard / block start combination(s) to determine if the series exists on disk.\n\n\nIf the series exists, then for every block that the request spans, M3DB needs to consolidate data from the active buffers, in-memory cache, and fileset files (disk).\n\n\nLets imagine a read for a given series that requests the last 6 hours worth of data, and an M3DB namespace that is configured with a blocksize of 2 hours (i.e we need to find 3 different blocks.)\n\n\nIf the current time is 8PM, then the location of the requested blocks might be as follows:\n\n\n[2PM - 4PM (FileSet file)]    - Sealed and flushed block that isn't cached\n[4PM - 6PM (In-memory cache)] - Sealed and flush block that is cached\n[6PM - 8PM (active buffer)]   - Hasn't been sealed or flushed yet\n\n\n\n\nThen M3DB will need to consolidate:\n\n\n\n\nThe not-yet-sealed block from the active buffers / encoders (located inside an internal lookup in the Series object) \n[6PM - 8PM]\n\n\nThe in-memory cached block (also located inside an internal lookup in the Series object) \n[4PM - 6PM]\n\n\nThe block from disk (the block retrieve from disk will then be cached according to the current \ncaching policy\n \n[2PM - 4PM]\n\n\n\n\nRetrieving blocks from the active buffers and in-memory cache is simple, the data is already present in memory and easily accessible via hashmaps keyed by series ID. Retrieving a block from disk is more complicated. The flow for retrieving a block from disk is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nConsult the in-memory bloom filter to determine if its possible the series exists on disk.\n\n\nIf the bloom filter returns positive, then binary search the in-memory index summaries to find the nearest index entry that is \nbefore\n the series ID that we're searching for. Review the \nindex_lookup.go\n file for implementation details.\n\n\nJump to the offset in the index file that we obtained from the binary search in the previous step, and begin scanning forward until we identify the index entry for the series ID we're looking for \nor\n we get far enough in the index file that it becomes clear that the ID we're looking for doesn't exist (this is possible because the index file is sorted by ID)\n\n\nJump to the offset in the data file that we obtained from scanning the index file in the previous step, and begin streaming data.\n\n\n\n\nOnce M3DB has retrieved the three blocks from their respective locations in memory / on-disk, it will transmit all of the data back to the client. Whether or not the client returns a success to the caller for the read is dependent on the configured \nconsistency level\n.\n\n\nNote:\n Since M3DB nodes return compressed blocks (the M3DB client decompresses them), it's not possible to return \"partial results\" for a given block. If any portion of a read request spans a given block, then that block in its entirety must be transmitted back to the client. In practice, this ends up being not much of an issue because of the high compression ratio that M3DB is able to achieve.\n\n\nBackground processes\n\n\nM3DB has a variety of processes that run in the background during normal operation.\n\n\nTicking\n\n\nThe ticking process runs continously in the background and is responsible for a variety of tasks:\n\n\n\n\nMerging all encoders for a given series / block start combination\n\n\nRemoving expired / flushed series and blocks from memory\n\n\nCleanup of expired data (fileset/commit log) from the filesystem\n\n\n\n\nMerging all encoders\n\n\nM3TSZ is designed for compressing time series data in which each datapoint has a timestamp that is larger than the last encoded datapoint. For monitoring workloads this works very well because every subsequent datapoint is almost always larger than the previous one. However, real world systems are messy and occassionally out of order writes will be received. When this happens, M3DB will allocate a new encoder for the out of order datapoints. The multiple encoders need to be merged before flushing the data to disk, but to prevent huge memory spikes during the flushing process we continuously merge out of order encoders in the background.\n\n\nRemoving expired / flushed series and blocks from memory\n\n\nDepending on the configured \ncaching policy\n, the \nin-memory object layout\n can end up with references to series or data blocks that are expired (have fallen out of the retention period) or no longer need to be in memory (due to the data being flushed to disk or no longer needing to be cached). The background tick will identify these structures and release them from memory.\n\n\nFlushing\n\n\nAs discussed in the \narchitecture\n section, writes are actively buffered / compressed in-memory and the commit log is continuously being written to, but eventually data needs to be flushed to disk in the form of \nfileset files\n to facilitate efficient storage and retrieval.\n\n\nThis is where the configurable \"blocksize\" comes into play. The blocksize is simply a duration of time that dictates how long active writes will be compressed (in a streaming manner) in memory before being \"sealed\" (marked as immutable) and flushed to disk. Lets use a blocksize of two hours as an example.\n\n\nIf the blocksize is set to two hours, then all writes for all series for a given shard will be buffered in memory for two hours at a time. At the end of the two hour period all of the \nfileset files\n will be generated, written to disk, and then the in-memory objects can be released and replaced with new ones for the new block. The old objects will be removed from memory in the subsequent tick.\n\n\nCaveats / Limitations\n\n\n\n\nM3DB currently supports exact ID based lookups. It does not support tag/secondary indexing. This feature is under development and future versions of M3DB will have support for a built-in reverse index.\n\n\nM3DB does not support updates / deletes. All data written to M3DB is immutable.\n\n\nM3DB does not support writing arbitrarily into the past and future. This is generally fine for monitoring workloads, but can be problematic for traditional \nOLTP\n and \nOLAP\n workloads. Future versions of M3DB will have better support for writes with arbitrary timestamps.\n\n\nM3DB does not support writing datapoints with values other than double-precision floats. Future versions of M3DB will have support for storing arbitrary values.\n\n\nM3DB does not support storing data with an indefinite retention period, every namespace in M3DB is required to have a retention policy which specifies how long data in that namespace will be retained for. While there is no upper bound on that value (Uber has production databases running with retention periods as high as 5 years), its still required and generally speaking M3DB is optimized for workloads with a well-defined \nTTL\n.\n\n\nM3DB does not support either background data repair or Cassandra-style \nread repairs\n. Future versions of M3DB will support automatic repairs of data as an ongoing background process.",

This high compression ratio is implemented via the M3TSZ algorithm, a variant of the streaming time series compression algorithm described in  Facebook's Gorilla paper  with a few small differences.  The compression ratio will vary depending on the workload and configuration, but we found that with M3TSZ we were able to achieve a compression ratio of 1.45 bytes/datapoint with Uber's production workloads. This was a 40% improvement over standard TSZ which only gave us a compression ratio of 2.42 bytes/datapoint under the same conditions.",

A  database  \"owns\" numerous namespaces, and each namespace has a unique name as well as distinct configuration with regards to data retention and blocksize (which we will discuss in more detail later).  Namespaces  are similar to tables in other databases.    Shards  which are owned by  namespaces .  Shards  are effectively the same as \"virtual shards\" in Cassandra in that they provide arbitrary distribution of time series data via a simple hash of the series ID.    Series  which are owned by  shards . A  series  is generally what comes to mind when you think of \"time series\" data. Ex. The CPU level for a single host in a datacenter over a period of time could be represented as a series with id \" .system.cpu.utilization\" and a vector of tuples in the form of (TIMESTAMP, CPU_LEVEL). In other words, if you were rendering a graph a series would represent a single line on that graph. Note that the previous example is only a logical illustration and does not represent the way that M3DB actually stores data.    Blocks  belong to a series and are central to M3DB's design. A  block  is simply a smaller wrapper object around a sealed (no longer writable) stream of compressed time series data. The compression comes with a few caveats though, namely that you cannot read individual datapoints in a compressed block. In other words, in order to read a single datapoint you must decompress the entire block up to the datapoint that you're trying to read.    If M3DB kept everything in memory (and in fact, early versions of it did), than you could conceptually think of it as being a composed from a hierarchy of maps:  database_obect      =  map \nnamespace_object    =  map \nshard_object        =  map \nseries_object       =  map \nseries_object       =  map  (This map should only have one or two entries)",

            "text": "While in-memory databases can be useful (and M3DB supports operating in a memory-only mode), some form of persistence is required for durability. In other words, without a persistence strategy then it would be impossible for M3DB to restart (or recover from a crash) without losing all of its data.  In addition, with large volumes of data it becomes prohibitively expensive to keep all of the data in memory. This is especially true for monitoring workloads which often follow a \"write-once, read-never\" pattern where less than a few percent of all the data that's stored is ever read. With that type of workload, its wasteful to keep all of that data in memory when it could be persisted on disk and retrieved when required.  Like most other databases, M3DB takes a two-pronged approach to persistant storage that involves combining a commitlog (for disaster recovery) with periodic snapshotting (for efficient retrieval):   All writes are persisted to a  commitlog  (the commitlog can be configured to fsync every write, or optionally batch writes together which is much faster but leaves open the possibility of small amounts of data loss in the case of a catastrophic failure). The commitlog is completely uncompressed and exists only to recover \"unflushed\" data in the case of a database shutdown (intentional or not) and is never used to satisfy a read request.  Periodically (based on the configured blocksize) all \"active\" blocks are \"sealed\" (marked as immutable) and flushed to disk as  \"fileset\" files . These files are highly compressed and can be indexed into via their complementary index files. Check out the  flushing section  to learn more about the background flushing process.   The blocksize parameter is the most important variable that needs to be tuned for your particular workload. A small blocksize will mean more frequent flushing and a smaller memory footprint for the data that is being actively compressed, but it will also reduce the compression ratio and your data will take up more space on disk.  If the database is stopped for any reason in-between \"flushes\" (writing fileset files out to disk), then when the node is started back up those writes will need to be recovered by reading the commitlog or streaming in the data from a peer responsible for the same shard (if the replication factor is larger than 1).  While the  fileset files  are designed to support efficient data retrieval via the series primary key (the ID), there is still a heavy cost associated with any query that has to retrieve data from disk because going to disk is always much slower than accessing main memory. To compensate for that, M3DB support various  caching policies  which can significantly improve the performance of reads by caching data in memory.",

If the encoder doesn't exist (no writes for this series have occurred yet as part of this block) then a new encoder will be allocated and it will begin a compressed M3TSZ stream with that datapoint. There is also some special logic for handling out-of-order writes which is discussed in the  merging all encoders section .  At the same time, the write will be appended to the commitlog queue (and depending on the commitlog configuration immediately fsync'd to disk or batched together with other writes and flushed out all at once).

The read request will contain the following information:   The namespace  The series ID (byte blob)  The period of time being requested (start and end)   M3DB will consult the database object to check if the namespace exists, and if it does, then it will hash the series ID to determine which shard it belongs to. If the node receiving the read owns that shard, then M3DB needs to determine two things:   Does the series exist? and if it does  Does the data exist in an \"active buffer\" (actively being compressed by an encoder), cached in-memory, on disk, or some combination of all three?   Determining whether the series exists is simple. M3DB looks up the series in the shard object. If it exists, then the series exists. If it doesn't, then M3DB consults an in-memory bloom filter(s) for that shard / block start combination(s) to determine if the series exists on disk.  If the series exists, then for every block that the request spans, M3DB needs to consolidate data from the active buffers, in-memory cache, and fileset files (disk).  Lets imagine a read for a given series that requests the last 6 hours worth of data, and an M3DB namespace that is configured with a blocksize of 2 hours (i.e we need to find 3 different blocks.)  If the current time is 8PM, then the location of the requested blocks might be as follows:  [2PM - 4PM (FileSet file)]    - Sealed and flushed block that isn't cached\n[4PM - 6PM (In-memory cache)] - Sealed and flush block that is cached\n[6PM - 8PM (active buffer)]   - Hasn't been sealed or flushed yet  Then M3DB will need to consolidate:   The not-yet-sealed block from the active buffers / encoders (located inside an internal lookup in the Series object)  [6PM - 8PM]  The in-memory cached block (also located inside an internal lookup in the Series object)  [4PM - 6PM]  The block from disk (the block retrieve from disk will then be cached according to the current  caching policy   [2PM - 4PM]   Retrieving blocks from the active buffers and in-memory cache is simple, the data is already present in memory and easily accessible via hashmaps keyed by series ID. Retrieving a block from disk is more complicated. The flow for retrieving a block from disk is as follows:   Consult the in-memory bloom filter to determine if its possible the series exists on disk.  If the bloom filter returns positive, then binary search the in-memory index summaries to find the nearest index entry that is  before  the series ID that we're searching for. Review the  index_lookup.go  file for implementation details.  Jump to the offset in the index file that we obtained from the binary search in the previous step, and begin scanning forward until we identify the index entry for the series ID we're looking for  or  we get far enough in the index file that it becomes clear that the ID we're looking for doesn't exist (this is possible because the index file is sorted by ID)  Jump to the offset in the data file that we obtained from scanning the index file in the previous step, and begin streaming data.   Once M3DB has retrieved the three blocks from their respective locations in memory / on-disk, it will transmit all of the data back to the client. Whether or not the client returns a success to the caller for the read is dependent on the configured  consistency level .  Note:  Since M3DB nodes return compressed blocks (the M3DB client decompresses them), it's not possible to return \"partial results\" for a given block. If any portion of a read request spans a given block, then that block in its entirety must be transmitted back to the client. In practice, this ends up being not much of an issue because of the high compression ratio that M3DB is able to achieve.",

This is where the configurable \"blocksize\" comes into play. The blocksize is simply a duration of time that dictates how long active writes will be compressed (in a streaming manner) in memory before being \"sealed\" (marked as immutable) and flushed to disk. Lets use a blocksize of two hours as an example.  If the blocksize is set to two hours, then all writes for all series for a given shard will be buffered in memory for two hours at a time. At the end of the two hour period all of the  fileset files  will be generated, written to disk, and then the in-memory objects can be released and replaced with new ones for the new block. The old objects will be removed from memory in the subsequent tick.",

This feature is under development and future versions of M3DB will have support for a built-in reverse index.  M3DB does not support updates / deletes. All data written to M3DB is immutable.  M3DB does not support writing arbitrarily into the past and future. This is generally fine for monitoring workloads, but can be problematic for traditional  OLTP  and  OLAP  workloads. Future versions of M3DB will have better support for writes with arbitrary timestamps.  M3DB does not support writing datapoints with values other than double-precision floats. Future versions of M3DB will have support for storing arbitrary values.  M3DB does not support storing data with an indefinite retention period, every namespace in M3DB is required to have a retention policy which specifies how long data in that namespace will be retained for. While there is no upper bound on that value (Uber has production databases running with retention periods as high as 5 years), its still required and generally speaking M3DB is optimized for workloads with a well-defined  TTL .

            "text": "Commit Logs\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nM3DB has a commit log that is equivalent to the commit log or write-ahead-log in other databases.

            "text": "Peer Streaming\n\n\nClient\n\n\nPeer streaming is managed by the M3DB client.  It fetches all blocks from peers for a specified time range for bootstrapping purposes.  It performs the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nFetch all metadata for blocks from all peers who own the specified shard\n\n\nCompares metadata from different peers and determines the best peer(s) from which to stream the actual data\n\n\nStreams the block data from peers\n\n\n\n\nSteps 1, 2 and 3 all happen concurrently.  As metadata streams in, we begin determining which peer is the best source to stream a given block's data for a given series from, and then we begin streaming data from that peer while we continue to receive metadata.  If the checksum for a given series block matches all three replicas then the least loaded (in terms of outstanding requests) and recently attempted will be selected to stream from.  If the checksum differs for the series block across any of the peers then a fanout fetch of the series block is performed.\n\n\nIn terms of error handling, the client will respect the consistency level specified for bootstrap.  This means that when fetching metadata, indefinite retry is performed until the consistency level is achieved, for instance for quorum a majority of peers must successfully return metadata.  For fetching the block data, if checksum matches from all peers then one successful fetch must occur, unless bootstrap consistency level \"none\" is specified, and if checksum mismatches then the specified consistency level must be achieved when the series block fetch is fanned out to peers.  Fetching block data as well will indefinitely retry until the consistency level is achieved.\n\n\nThe client supports dynamically changing the bootstrap consistency level, which is helfpul in disaster scenarios where the consistency level cannot be achieved.  To break the indefinite streaming attempt an operator can change the consistency level to \"none\" and a purely best-effort will be made to fetch the metadata and correspondingly to fetch the block data.\n\n\nThe diagram below depicts the control flow and concurrency (goroutines and channels) in detail:\n\n\n

            "text": "Peer streaming is managed by the M3DB client.  It fetches all blocks from peers for a specified time range for bootstrapping purposes.  It performs the following steps:   Fetch all metadata for blocks from all peers who own the specified shard  Compares metadata from different peers and determines the best peer(s) from which to stream the actual data  Streams the block data from peers   Steps 1, 2 and 3 all happen concurrently.  As metadata streams in, we begin determining which peer is the best source to stream a given block's data for a given series from, and then we begin streaming data from that peer while we continue to receive metadata.  If the checksum for a given series block matches all three replicas then the least loaded (in terms of outstanding requests) and recently attempted will be selected to stream from.  If the checksum differs for the series block across any of the peers then a fanout fetch of the series block is performed.  In terms of error handling, the client will respect the consistency level specified for bootstrap.  This means that when fetching metadata, indefinite retry is performed until the consistency level is achieved, for instance for quorum a majority of peers must successfully return metadata.  For fetching the block data, if checksum matches from all peers then one successful fetch must occur, unless bootstrap consistency level \"none\" is specified, and if checksum mismatches then the specified consistency level must be achieved when the series block fetch is fanned out to peers.  Fetching block data as well will indefinitely retry until the consistency level is achieved.  The client supports dynamically changing the bootstrap consistency level, which is helfpul in disaster scenarios where the consistency level cannot be achieved.  To break the indefinite streaming attempt an operator can change the consistency level to \"none\" and a purely best-effort will be made to fetch the metadata and correspondingly to fetch the block data.

Blocks that have already been sealed, however, don't need to remain in-memory. In order to support efficient reads, M3DB implements various caching policies which determine which flushed blocks are kept in memory, and which are not. The \"cache\" itself is not a separate datastructure in memory, cached blocks are simply stored in their respective \nin-memory objects\n with various different mechanisms (depending on the chosen cache policy) determining which series / blocks are evicted and which are retained.\n\n\nFor general purpose workloads, the \nlru\n caching policy is reccommended.\n\n\nNone Cache Policy\n\n\nThe \nnone\n cache policy is the simplest. As soon as a block is sealed, its flushed to disk and never retained in memory again. This cache policy will have the lowest memory consumption, but also the poorest read performance as every read for a block that is already flushed will require a disk read.\n\n\nAll Cache Policy\n\n\nThe \nall\n cache policy is the opposite of the \nnone\n cache policy. All blocks are kept in memory until their retention period is over. This policy can be useful for read-heavy workloads with small datasets, but is obviously limited by the amount of memory on the host machine. Also keep in mind that this cache policy may have unintended side-effects on write throughput as keeping every block in memory creates a lot of work for the Golang garbage collector.\n\n\nRecently Read Cache Policy\n\n\nThe \nrecently_read\n cache policy keeps all blocks that are read from disk in memory for a configurable duration of time. For example, if the \nrecently_read\n cache policy is set with a duration of 10 minutes, then everytime a block is read from disk it will be kept in memory for at least 10 minutes. This policy can be very effective if only a small portion of your overall dataset is ever read, and especially if that subset is read frequently (i.e as is common in the case of database backing an automatic alerting system), but it can cause very high memory usage during workloads that involve sequentially scanning all of the data.\n\n\nData eviction from memory is triggered by the \"ticking\" process described in the \nbackground processes section\n\n\nLeast Recently Used (LRU) Cache Policy\n\n\nThe \nlru\n cache policy uses an \nlru\n list with a configurable max size to keep track of which blocks have been read least recently, and evicts those blocks first when the capacity of the list is full and a new block needs to be read from disk.

A \nBlock\n is associated with a start and end time. It contains data from multiple time series stored in columnar format.\n\n\nMost transformations within M3Coordinator will be applied across different series for each time interval. Therefore, having data stored in columnar format helps with the memory locality of the data. Moreover, most transformations within M3Coordinator can work in parallel on different blocks which can significantly increase the computation speed.\n\n\nDiagram\n\n\nBelow is a visual representation of a set of \nBlocks\n. On top is the M3QL query that gets executed, and on the bottom, are the results of the query containing 3 different Blocks.\n\n\n

M3DB blocks into M3Coordinator blocks, we need to consolidate across different namespaces. In short, M3DB namespaces are essentially different resolutions that metrics are stored at. For example, a metric might be stored at both 1min and 10min resolutions- meaning this metric is found in two namespaces.\n\n\nAt a high level, M3DB returns to M3Coordinator \nSeriesBlocks\n that contain a list of \nSeriesIterators\n for a given timeseries per namespace. M3Coordinator then aligns the blocks across common time bounds before applying consolidation.\n\n\nFor example, let's say we have a query that returns two timeseries from two different namespaces- 1min and 10min. When we create the M3Coordinator \nBlock\n, in order to accurately consolidate results from these two namespaces, we need to convert everything to have a 10min resolution. Otherwise it will not be possible to perform correctly apply functions.\n\n\n\n\nComing Soon: More documentation on how M3Coordinator applies consolidation.",

A  Block  is associated with a start and end time. It contains data from multiple time series stored in columnar format.  Most transformations within M3Coordinator will be applied across different series for each time interval. Therefore, having data stored in columnar format helps with the memory locality of the data. Moreover, most transformations within M3Coordinator can work in parallel on different blocks which can significantly increase the computation speed.",

            "text": "In order to convert M3DB blocks into M3Coordinator blocks, we need to consolidate across different namespaces. In short, M3DB namespaces are essentially different resolutions that metrics are stored at. For example, a metric might be stored at both 1min and 10min resolutions- meaning this metric is found in two namespaces.  At a high level, M3DB returns to M3Coordinator  SeriesBlocks  that contain a list of  SeriesIterators  for a given timeseries per namespace. M3Coordinator then aligns the blocks across common time bounds before applying consolidation.  For example, let's say we have a query that returns two timeseries from two different namespaces- 1min and 10min. When we create the M3Coordinator  Block , in order to accurately consolidate results from these two namespaces, we need to convert everything to have a 10min resolution. Otherwise it will not be possible to perform correctly apply functions.   Coming Soon: More documentation on how M3Coordinator applies consolidation.",

In practice, you'd be automating this using Terraform or using Kubernetes rather than doing this by hand; guides for doing so are available under the How-To section.\n\n\nPrimer Architecture\n\n\nA quick primer on M3DB architecture. Here\u2019s what a typical deployment looks like:\n\n\n\n\nA few different things to highlight about the diagram:\n\n\nRole Type\n\n\nThere are three \u2018role types\u2019 for a m3db deployment -\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinator: \nm3coordinator\n serves to coordinate reads and writes across all hosts in the cluster. It\u2019s a lightweight process, and does not store any data. This role would typically be run alongside a Prometheus instance, or be baked into a collector agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStorage Node: \nm3dbnode\n processes running on these hosts are the workhorses of the database, they store data; and serve reads and writes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeed Node: First and foremost, these hosts are storage nodes themselves. In addition to that responsibility, they run an embedded ETCD server. This is to allow the various M3DB processes running across the cluster to reason about the topology/configuration of the cluster in a consistent manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: In very large deployments, you\u2019d use a dedicated ETCD cluster, and only use M3DB Storage and Coordinator Nodes\n\n\nProvisioning\n\n\nEnough background, lets get you going with a real cluster! Provision your host (be it VMs from AWS/GCP/etc) or bare-metal servers in your DC with the latest and greatest flavour of Linux you favor. M3DB works on all popular distributions - Ubuntu/RHEL/CentOS, let us know if you run into issues on another platform and we\u2019ll be happy to assist.\n\n\nNetwork\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using AWS or GCP it is highly advised to use static IPs so that if you need to replace a host, you don\u2019t have to update your configuration files on all the hosts, you simply decomission the old seed node and provision a new seed node with the same host ID and static IP that the old seed node had.  For AWS you can use a \nElastic Network Interface\n on a VPC and for GCP you can simply use an \ninternal static IP address\n.\n\n\nIn this example you will be creating three static IP addresses for the three seed nodes.\n\n\nFurther, we assume you have hostnames configured correctly too. i.e. running \nhostname\n on a host in the cluster returns the host ID you'll be using when specifying instance host IDs when creating the M3DB cluster placement. E.g. running \nhostname\n on a node \nm3db001\n should return it's host ID \nm3db001\n.\n\n\nIn GCP the name of your instance when you create it will automatically be it's hostname. When you create an instance click \"Management, disks, networking, SSH keys\" and under \"Networking\" click the default interface and click the \"Primary internal IP\" drop down and select \"Reserve a static internal IP address\" and give it a name, i.e. \nm3db001\n, a description that describes it's a seed node IP address and use \"Assign automatically\".\n\n\nIn AWS it might be simpler to just use whatever the hostname you get for the provisioned VM as your host ID when specifying M3DB placement.  Either that or use the \nenvironment\n host ID resolver and pass your host ID when launching the database process with an environment variable.  You can set to the host ID and specify the environment variable name in config as \nenvVarName: M3DB_HOST_ID\n if you are using an environment variable named \nM3DB_HOST_ID\n.\n\n\nRelevant config snippet:\n\n\nhostID:\n  resolver: environment\n  envVarName: M3DB_HOST_ID\n\n\n\n\nThen start your process with:\n\n\nM3DB_HOST_ID=m3db001 m3dbnode -f config.yml\n\n\n\n\nKernel\n\n\nm3dbnode\n uses a lot of mmap-ed files for performance, as a result, you might need to bump \nvm.max_map_count\n. We suggest setting this value to 262,144 when provisioning your VM, so you don\u2019t have to come back and debug issues later.\n\n\nOS\n\n\nm3dbnode\n also can use a high number of files and we suggest setting a high max open number of files due to per partition fileset volumes.\n\n\nOn linux you can set a high limit for number of max open files in \n/etc/security/limits.conf\n:\n\n\nyour_m3db_user        hard nofile 500000\nyour_m3db_user        soft nofile 500000\n\n\n\n\nBefore running the process make sure the limits are set, if running manually you can raise the limit for the current user with \nulimit -n 500000\n.\n\n\nConfig files\n\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t feel right to call this guide, \u201cThe Hard Way\u201d and not require you to change some configs by hand.\n\n\nNote: the steps that follow assume you have the following 3 seed nodes - make necessary adjustment if you have more or are using a dedicated ETCD cluster. Example seed nodes:\n\n\n\n\nm3db001 (Region=us-east1, Zone=us-east1-a, Static IP=10.142.0.1)\n\n\nm3db002 (Region=us-east1, Zone=us-east1-b, Static IP=10.142.0.2)\n\n\nm3db003 (Region=us-east1, Zone=us-east1-c, Static IP=10.142.0.3)\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re going to start with the M3DB config template and modify it to work for your cluster. Start by downloading the \nconfig\n. Update the config \u2018service\u2019 and 'seedNodes' sections to read as follows:\n\n\nconfig:\n  service:\n    env: default_env\n    zone: embedded\n    service: m3db\n    cacheDir: /var/lib/m3kv\n    etcdClusters:\n      - zone: embedded\n        endpoints:\n          - 10.142.0.1:2379\n          - 10.142.0.2:2379\n          - 10.142.0.3:2379\n  seedNodes:\n    initialCluster:\n      - hostID: m3db001\n        endpoint: http://10.142.0.1:2380\n      - hostID: m3db002\n        endpoint: http://10.142.0.2:2380\n      - hostID: m3db003\n        endpoint: http://10.142.0.3:2380\n\n\n\n\nStart the seed nodes\n\n\nTransfer the config you just crafted to each host in the cluster. And then starting with the seed nodes, start up the m3dbnode process:\n\n\nm3dbnode -f \nconfig-name.yml\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, remember to daemon-ize this using your favourite utility: systemd/init.d/supervisor/etc\n\n\nInitialize Topology\n\n\nM3DB calls its cluster topology \u2018placement\u2019. Run the command below on any of the seed nodes to initialize your first placement.\n\n\nNote: Isolation group specifies how the cluster places shards to avoid more than one replica of a shard appearing in the same replica group. As such you must be using at least as many isolation groups as your replication factor. In this example we use the availibity zones \nus-east1-a\n, \nus-east1-b\n, \nus-east1-c\n as our isolation groups which matches our replication factor of 3.\n\n\ncurl -X POST localhost:7201/api/v1/placement/init -d '{\n    \nnum_shards\n: 1024,\n    \nreplication_factor\n: 3,\n    \ninstances\n: [\n        {\n            \nid\n: \nm3db001\n,\n            \nisolation_group\n: \nus-east1-a\n,\n            \nzone\n: \nembedded\n,\n            \nweight\n: 100,\n            \nendpoint\n: \n10.142.0.1:9000\n,\n            \nhostname\n: \nm3db001\n,\n            \nport\n: 9000\n        },\n        {\n            \nid\n: \nm3db002\n,\n            \nisolation_group\n: \nus-east1-b\n,\n            \nzone\n: \nembedded\n,\n            \nweight\n: 100,\n            \nendpoint\n: \n10.142.0.2:9000\n,\n            \nhostname\n: \nm3db002-us-east\n,\n            \nport\n: 9000\n        },\n        {\n            \nid\n: \nm3db003\n,\n            \nisolation_group\n: \nus-east1-c\n,\n            \nzone\n: \nembedded\n,\n            \nweight\n: 100,\n            \nendpoint\n: \n10.142.0.3:9000\n,\n            \nhostname\n: \nm3db003\n,\n            \nport\n: 9000\n        }\n    ]\n}'\n\n\n\n\nCreate namespace(s)\n\n\nA namespace in M3DB is similar to a table in Cassandra (C*).

For AWS you can use a  Elastic Network Interface  on a VPC and for GCP you can simply use an  internal static IP address .  In this example you will be creating three static IP addresses for the three seed nodes.  Further, we assume you have hostnames configured correctly too. i.e. running  hostname  on a host in the cluster returns the host ID you'll be using when specifying instance host IDs when creating the M3DB cluster placement. E.g. running  hostname  on a node  m3db001  should return it's host ID  m3db001 .  In GCP the name of your instance when you create it will automatically be it's hostname. When you create an instance click \"Management, disks, networking, SSH keys\" and under \"Networking\" click the default interface and click the \"Primary internal IP\" drop down and select \"Reserve a static internal IP address\" and give it a name, i.e.  m3db001 , a description that describes it's a seed node IP address and use \"Assign automatically\".  In AWS it might be simpler to just use whatever the hostname you get for the provisioned VM as your host ID when specifying M3DB placement.  Either that or use the  environment  host ID resolver and pass your host ID when launching the database process with an environment variable.  You can set to the host ID and specify the environment variable name in config as  envVarName: M3DB_HOST_ID  if you are using an environment variable named  M3DB_HOST_ID .  Relevant config snippet:  hostID:\n  resolver: environment\n  envVarName: M3DB_HOST_ID  Then start your process with:  M3DB_HOST_ID=m3db001 m3dbnode -f config.yml",
