# Governance

M3 is owned by Uber, and is governed by its Technical Steering Committee (the
"TSC").

The current members of the TSC are:

- @jimjag (Uber)
- @martin-mao (Chronosphere)
- @mway (Uber)
- @prateek (Uber)
- @robskillington (Chronosphere)

While the TSC aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC
decision requires a vote to move the proposal forward, decisions by vote require
a majority vote of all TSC members.

To reach the TSC directly, please email m3-tsc@uber.com. For administrative
questions or issues, please contact ospo@uber.com. To add the TSC to issues or
pull requests, add the [TSC label](https://github.com/m3db/m3/labels/TSC).
